At work, I have been using [Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line.html) at the command line for some tasks and learned a bit about what works and what doesn't. Now I finally got around to trying out [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) for a private vibe coding project.

## The Project

I wanted to write a small command line utility that displays the weather for a given location on the command line. I wanted to use Python as a programming language and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as the build and dependency tracking system.
